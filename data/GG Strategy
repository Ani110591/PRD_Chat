Golden Gate Process Strategy

1. The strategy is to validate Price Correction & Time Correction in that order specifically.

Pre-Conditions:

- The stock chart should be loaded with the last 6 months of candlestick pattern data

- There should be exponential moving average indicators of 20Dday, 50 days, 100 days, 200 days in the chart.



Conditions:

1. Price Correction: The Candlestick which represents the price (CMP) should decisively touch the 200day exponential moving average curve. Decisively means at least 2 candles should touch it and not just a whisk like a tangent of a circle

Configuration: Number of candles here should be a configuration that can be added by the user



2. Time Correction: After Price correction has happened the following 2 conditions should happen

a. within the next 6-10 candles there should be convergence of the other 3 exponential moving average curves i.e., 20 Days, 50 days & 100 days. Define convergence as all 3 curves are within 1% of each other.

Configruation: The number of candles to wait should be a configuration that can be added by the user



b. At the same time when condition a is met, the average of 20 day, 50day, 100 day Exponential Moving average should be less than 5% away from the 200 DMA

Configuration: The %age distance between these should again be a configuration



Indicators:

On Chart: Create a visual indicator using an arrow mark at the candle where the Golden Gate Indicator has appeared to visually indicate the location
Via Notification: Create an alert that gets triggered when the conditions above are met. This Alert should be an SMS, an Email & a app notification on tradingView
